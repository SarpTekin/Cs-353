		<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<p>HireMe is a web based platform which is intended to help developers
				to find a suitable job as well as the companies find the right employee for
				their available positions. Nowadays, there are numerous topics and
				expertise regarding computer science and development. Each company
				needs some criteria in order to hire people and mostly that criteria consists
				of quizzes, questionnaires and interviews. Developers have to take each
				company’s quiz separately which is a tedious task. HireMe is a platform
				that makes this task easier and more efficient for both companies and job
				candidates. By taking a single quiz on a certain topic the candidates can
				directly pass to the interview section with the company. This way, neither
				the developers nor the companies will waste time on generating questions
				and taking multiple similar quizzes.

		<h2>Project Description</h2>
		<section class="three_columns">
		<div class="column2">
			<p>There will be three types of users in this project consisting of
				Applicant, Employer and Admin. The information of each of them will be
				stored in our database. In the application, Applicants will be able to choose
				a topic that they want to work on and take a quiz regarding that topic.
				Admins are responsible for generating the quiz questions. Each quiz will
				have a comprehensive leaderboard table in which the scores, ID’s and
				names of the Applicant will be stored. Companies will be able to search for
				topics and filter the results by setting thresholds and list all of the Applicant
				names based on the filters.
