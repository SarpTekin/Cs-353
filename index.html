                for a hiring company. You have developlers, companies, company representatives, questions,
                subjects, quizzes, trials and so on. Admin should be responsible for generating questions and
                their options. Developers can take quizzes for different expertise areas and the process can have
                multiple trials. Each result of taking a quiz should be recorded in detail. Companies can search
                for candidates with results above certain threshold in multiple subjects. According to search,
                company representative can send an interview request to candidate, which then can be accepted
                or declined by the candidate.</p>
